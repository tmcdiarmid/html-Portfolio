<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>After attending 5 different universities and changing my major 3 times I have 
  landed on the greatest job in the world.  I teach middle school students that have 
  just arrived in the US, mostly.  See, the school I teach at Utah International 
  Charter School (UICS) and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) in Salt Lake 
  City, UT, sends newly arrived refugee children in grades 6 through 12 to us to 
  help them navigate schools in the U.S., learn English, and connect them with the 
  information they need to get training or schooling so the can get into careers 
  they choose. I teach math to these students.  Some of them struggle with math, 
  but the newly arrived almost always struggle to communicate in English. But UICS 
  does a great job of getting students to fluency than most other schools, using 
  collaborative groups, content-based literacy, PBL, and portfolio work. These 
  students also deserve to know about computer science, but we can't offer that 
  to them yet, so I want to integrate it into my math curriculum. 
  I also love any time I spend with my two children, and four grandchildren, 
  hiking, gardening, and learning.
